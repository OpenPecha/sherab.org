# sherab.org

Purpose
*******

This README provides setup instructions, basic commands, and operational details for managing sherab.org which is based on Open edX platform using Tutor.

The `sherab.org <https://sherab.org)>`_ is a service-oriented platform for authoring and
delivering online learning at any scale.  The platform is written in
Python and JavaScript and makes extensive use of the Django
framework. At the highest level, the platform is composed of a
monolith, some independently deployable applications (IDAs), and
micro-frontends (MFEs) based on the ReactJS.

This repository hosts the monolith at the center which is derived from the Open edX
platform.  Functionally, the sherab.org repository provides two services:

* CMS (Content Management Service), which powers Open sherab Studio, the platform's learning content authoring environment; and
* LMS (Learning Management Service), which delivers learning content.
